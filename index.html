The IDAI Land Force unites tanks, artillery, missile systems, anti-air units, and engineering vehicles into a single multidimensional shield that secures the land, fortifies the borders, and dominates every battlefield simultaneously.<br><br>

	Its IRON Legion tanks are steel predators forged in resilience, the Crimson Barrage Assembly artillery rains crimson fire with unmatched precision, the Inferno Lance Corps missile systems strike with overwhelming force, and the Steel Vanguard Battalion armored carriers ensure mobility and protection across hostile terrain. Together, they form not just a defense but a living monument of supremacy.<br><br>

	The IDAI Land Force is more than a military power—it is a grand emblem of resilience, unity, and eternal dominion. Its presence upon the earth ensures IDAI’s rule over every horizon of the land.<br><br>
